# You have an unsorted array arr of non-negative integers and a number s.
# Find a longest contiguous subarray in arr that has a sum equal to s.

# Return two integers that represent its inclusive bounds.

# If there are several possible answers, return the one with the smallest left bound.

# If there are no answers, return [-1].

# Your answer should be 1-based, meaning that the first position of the array is 1 instead of 0.

# NaÃ¯ve solution
