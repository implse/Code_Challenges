# Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's
# about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur
# algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

# The pixels in the input image are represented as integers.

# The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: Every pixel x in the output
# image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that
# has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

# Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
