# Goal

At the end the day, to create your company, you do not need to have an idea. One can
take an idea that already works and redo the same thing. Then, you just need to buy
clicks and set-up a successful e-marketing campaign.  So you see things in big: you will
be  replicating  ebay  because  creating  an  auction  site  is  not  that  complicated.  You
receive  auctions,  you  check  that  they  are  strictly  above  the  reserve  price  and  you
determine the name of the winner at the end.

## Data

  #### Input

  Row 1: an Integer N between 2 and 1000 corresponding to the number of received bids.

  Row 2: an integer between 1 and 500 corresponding to the reserve price the object.

  Row 3 to N + 2: an integer P between 1 and 10000 and a string of character E separated by a space where P corresponds to the bid price and E corresponds to the bidder's first name.

#### Output

A string corresponding to the winner's first name. If no one wins the auction (because
all bids are less than or equal to the reserver price), return the string KO.
You are guaranteed that if there is a winner, then there is only one.
