# Goal


You have finally decided to monetize your knowledge in algorithmics by offering
private lessons to parents filled with unjustified hopes.  

You quickly become very popular, too popular, you are no longer sure to be able to take
all  your  classes.  

To have more chance to acquire  your knowledge, all your students offer you two slots
of 60 minutes during which they are available, you will be able to give them lessons
on only one of these two slots.(if you have the time)

Knowing that you can only teach one student at a time and that you can not start one
class and finish another one at the same time, what is the maximum number of students you can take?

Indication: you can proceed by exhaustive enumeration (brute force).

### Input

Row 1: an integer N between 3 and 11 inclusive, the number of students.

Rows 2 to N + 1: two integers between 0 and 1000 inclusive, the two starts
of slots (in minutes) at which a student is available, each slot has a duration
of 60 minutes from the beginning indicated.

### Output

The maximum number of different students that it is possible to take
