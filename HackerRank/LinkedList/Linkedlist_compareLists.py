# Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two linked lists.
# Compare the data in the nodes of the linked lists to check if they are equal.
# The lists are equal only if they have the same number of nodes and corresponding nodes contain the same data.
# Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data=None, next_node=None):
       self.data = data
       self.next = next_node

        return 0
