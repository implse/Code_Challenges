# Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists.
# The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order.
# Change the next pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order.
# Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

    def __init__(self, data=None, next_node=None):
       self.data = data
